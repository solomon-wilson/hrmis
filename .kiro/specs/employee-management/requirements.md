# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Employee Management feature provides the core foundation for an HR management system, enabling HR administrators and managers to maintain comprehensive employee records, track organizational structure, and manage basic employee lifecycle operations. This feature serves as the central hub for employee data that other HR modules will depend on, including personal information, job details, organizational hierarchy, and employment status tracking.

## Requirements

WHEN an HR administrator accesses the employee creation form THEN the system SHALL display fields for personal information (first name, last name, email, phone, address), job information (job title, department, manager, start date, employment type), and identification (employee ID, social security number)
2. WHEN an HR administrator submits a new employee form with valid data THEN the system SHALL create the employee record and assign a unique employee ID
3. WHEN an HR administrator submits a new employee form with invalid or missing required data THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent record creation
4. WHEN an HR administrator updates an existing employee record THEN the system SHALL save the changes and maintain an audit trail of modifications
5. IF an employee email address already exists in the system THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate employee creation and display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HR administrator enters search criteria in the employee search field THEN the system SHALL return matching employees based on name, employee ID, email, or department
2. WHEN an HR administrator applies filters (department, employment status, job title, manager) THEN the system SHALL display only employees matching the selected criteria
3. WHEN an HR administrator views the employee list THEN the system SHALL display key information (name, employee ID, department, job title, status) in a sortable table format
4. WHEN search results exceed 50 employees THEN the system SHALL implement pagination with navigation controls
5. WHEN no employees match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL display a "no results found" message with suggestions to modify search terms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want to manage employee status and lifecycle events, so that I can track employment changes and maintain accurate organizational records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HR administrator changes an employee status to "terminated" THEN the system SHALL require a termination date and reason, and update the employee record accordingly
2. WHEN an HR administrator changes an employee status to "on leave" THEN the system SHALL require leave start date, expected return date, and leave type
3. WHEN an employee's status is changed THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of all status changes with timestamps and the user who made the change
4. WHEN an HR administrator views an employee's profile THEN the system SHALL display current status prominently and provide access to status history
5. IF an employee is marked as terminated THEN the system SHALL prevent further modifications to their core employment data while maintaining read access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to view my direct reports and their basic information, so that I can access relevant employee data for team management purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager logs into the system THEN the system SHALL display a list of their direct reports based on the organizational hierarchy
2. WHEN a manager views their team list THEN the system SHALL show employee names, job titles, contact information, and current status
3. WHEN a manager clicks on a direct report THEN the system SHALL display the employee's detailed profile with appropriate permissions
4. IF a manager attempts to edit employee information THEN the system SHALL only allow updates to fields they have permission to modify (such as performance notes)
5. WHEN the organizational structure changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update manager-employee relationships and reflect changes in team views

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to view and update my own profile information, so that I can keep my personal details current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL display their current personal and job information in a read-only format for most fields
2. WHEN an employee updates editable fields (personal phone, address, emergency contact) THEN the system SHALL save the changes immediately
3. WHEN an employee attempts to modify restricted fields (salary, job title, department) THEN the system SHALL display these as read-only with a message indicating HR approval is required for changes
4. WHEN an employee submits a change request for restricted information THEN the system SHALL create a pending request for HR administrator review
5. IF an employee's profile has pending change requests THEN the system SHALL display the status of these requests prominently

### Requirement 6

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HR administrator selects report generation THEN the system SHALL provide options for employee roster, department breakdown, and status summary reports
2. WHEN an HR administrator generates a report THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by department, status, date ranges, and employment type
