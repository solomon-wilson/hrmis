# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Time and Attendance Management feature enables employees to track their work hours, request time off, and allows managers and HR administrators to monitor attendance patterns, approve leave requests, and generate time-based reports. This feature integrates with the Employee Management system to provide comprehensive workforce time tracking, supporting various work schedules, time-off policies, and compliance requirements for labor regulations.

## Requirements

2. WHEN an employee clocks in THEN the system SHALL record the timestamp, location (if enabled), and employee ID, and display confirmation of successful clock-in
3. WHEN an employee attempts to clock in while already clocked in THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate clock-in and display current status with option to clock out
4. WHEN an employee clocks out THEN the system SHALL calculate total hours worked for the shift and display the summary
5. IF an employee forgets to clock out THEN the system SHALL allow manual time entry with manager approval required for corrections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to submit time-off requests for vacation, sick leave, and personal days, so that I can plan my absence and ensure proper approval workflow.

4. WHEN a time-off request is submitted THEN the system SHALL send notifications to the employee's manager and provide request tracking capabilities
5. IF a time-off request conflicts with already approved requests from the same team THEN the system SHALL flag the conflict and require manager review

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to review and approve time-off requests from my direct reports, so that I can ensure adequate team coverage and manage workload distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager accesses their approval dashboard THEN the system SHALL display pending time-off requests from direct reports with request details and team coverage impact
2. WHEN a manager reviews a time-off request THEN the system SHALL show employee's leave balance, request history, and potential scheduling conflicts
3. WHEN a manager approves or denies a request THEN the system SHALL update the request status, notify the employee, and update team calendars accordingly
4. WHEN a manager approves a request that would result in negative leave balance THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation and documentation
5. IF multiple requests create coverage issues THEN the system SHALL highlight conflicts and suggest alternative dates or partial approvals

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want to configure time-off policies and accrual rules, so that I can maintain consistent leave management across the organization and ensure policy compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria
